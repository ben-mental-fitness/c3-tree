                "themeDescLong": "We looked at how the healthcare system was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's what we found:Hospital care for non-COVID diseases dropped significantly, and these reductions lasted for at least six months. The impact was particularly severe for the most deprived and minority ethnic groups.Females, ethnic minority groups, and those in disadvantaged social classes were more likely to report disruptions in accessing healthcare. In fact, more than one in three people (35%) reported some form of disrupted access to healthcare during the pandemic.People who experienced disruptions in accessing healthcare were also more likely to have hospitalizations that could have been prevented or avoided. The main reasons for this increased risk were difficulties in getting appointments with doctors or specialists (like GPs or outpatient departments) and delays or cancellations in important medical procedures (such as surgeries or cancer treatments).To address these issues, action needs to be taken to address the inequalities in healthcare. Efforts should focus on reducing backlogs in postponed or cancelled care and providing targeted support to those who faced disruptions in accessing care.\n\nImportance: It's important to ensure that continuity of care is maintained during pandemic-related disruptions, especially for those who need it the most. Policies should be put in place to prioritize and support individuals who have experienced difficulties in accessing healthcare services.",

The study aims to answer important questions related to Long COVID, such as its definition, risk factors, consequences on physical and mental health, and its impact on work, education, and social relationships. The study also focuses on improving the diagnosis and management of Long COVID using GP records.The findings of the CONVALESCENCE study have been shared with policymakers, the NHS, and NICE to inform decision-making. Here are some key findings in different areas of research:\n\nLong COVID definition: Analysis of data from nine different Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) involving around 42,000 individuals revealed common symptoms of Long COVID, including fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, difficulty concentrating, and chest tightness. Cluster analysis identified two distinct patterns of symptoms, representing high and low symptom burden. The identified patterns were strongly associated with the length of time individuals experienced symptoms that affected their normal functioning.\n\nLong COVID risk: By analyzing data from ten LPS and electronic health records (EHR) using OpenSAFELY, researchers identified consistent risk factors for Long COVID. These factors included increasing age, female sex, white ethnicity, poor pre-pandemic general and mental health, overweight/obesity, and asthma.\n\nLong COVID outcomes: Analysis of EHR data demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular complications (such as blood clots), diabetes, and mental health complications up to a year after COVID-19 infection. Findings from LPS data also indicated that Long COVID can lead to worse mental health, subjective financial wellbeing, new benefit claims, and decreased household income. These findings suggest the need for extending employment protection and financial support to people with Long COVID.\n\nMethods to improve Long COVID diagnosis and management: The study identified issues with GP coding for Long COVID, which was low and inconsistent compared to other estimates of Long COVID prevalence. The team engaged in discussions with NICE and electronic health record software providers to address these findings and improve coding practices. Qualitative interviews conducted with individuals with Long COVID and healthcare professionals highlighted challenges in accessing healthcare services for Long COVID support, particularly for ethnic minority participants. These experiences have been shared with the NHSE/I Long COVID Taskforce.\n\nThe study also includes a deep phenotyping Long COVID Clinic, where wearable devices and smartphones are used for remote assessment to identify subclinical damage or dysfunction in individuals with Long COVID. Results from this phase of the study will be made available soon.\n\nOverall, the CONVALESCENCE study aims to provide valuable insights into various aspects of Long COVID and contribute to improving the understanding, diagnosis, and management of this condition",

They identified two main symptom patterns in each group ('no COVID-19,' 'COVID-19 in the last 12 weeks,' 'COVID-19 > 12 weeks ago'). Recent cases showed symptoms like loss of taste, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and muscle pains. Cases over 12 weeks ago exhibited long COVID symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, difficulty concentrating, and chest tightness. Recognizing these patterns can enhance diagnosis and improve patient access to treatment."

The effects varied from person to person, but our research found that those who already had poor mental health before the pandemic experienced even more difficulties. They had trouble accessing healthcare and faced economic challenges.\n\nWe also discovered that mental health worsened during the early stages of the pandemic. The severity of this decline varied depending on factors like a person's age, gender, and their mental and physical health history. Even after the lockdown ended, mental health did not fully recover.\n\nOur research also looked at how mild and moderate cases of COVID-19 affected mental health. \n\nImportance: Based on our findings, it's crucial to address the inequalities between people with mental health problems and those without when providing support during and after the pandemic. We need to ensure that everyone gets the help they need, regardless of their mental health status.",

Here's what we found:Furlough, which means being temporarily laid off from work, had some positive effects compared to those who lost their jobs completely. However, it wasn't as beneficial as remaining employed throughout the pandemic. People on furlough were more likely to experience psychological distress and feelings of loneliness compared to those who kept working.When it came to health behaviours, like exercising or eating well, there wasn't much evidence to suggest that social protection policies like furlough had negative effects. In other words, being on furlough didn't seem to make people less healthy in terms of their lifestyle choices.As for working from home, we didn't find clear evidence of it directly impacting mental well-being. However, we do need to keep an eye on potential health inequalities that may arise from this situation.Long COVID had some negative effects on people's financial well-being. They were more likely to experience financial difficulties, apply for benefits, and have reduced household income. This suggests that providing extended job protection and financial support for people with long COVID might be necessary.\n\nImportance: Based on our findings, it's important to implement social protection policies during the recovery period after the pandemic and during future economic crises. These policies can help support individuals and prevent negative impacts on their health.",

We aimed to understand which patient groups were receiving these treatments and how effective they were. Here's what we found:We observed significant regional variations in the administration of treatments, with lower rates in socioeconomically deprived areas and care homes. This information helped us identify disparities in access to treatments among different communities.We then compared the effectiveness of two of the early-used treatments, molnupiravir and sotrovimab, in real-world settings. By linking primary care and other data, we were able to monitor drug coverage and assess their effects in near-real time. This approach allowed us to provide unbiased estimates of the effectiveness of these drugs.The data we gathered through our research has been valuable in informing prescribing guidance by organizations such as NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), NHSE (NHS England), and the WHO (World Health Organization) during their review of recent guidelines.In terms of policy implications, our work highlights the importance of utilizing linked data to conduct or simulate low-cost and rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This approach is particularly useful when drug effectiveness is expected to change rapidly. By leveraging data in this way, we can make informed decisions about treatment options more quickly and efficiently.\nImportance: In summary, our research demonstrates the value of leveraging linked data to monitor treatment rollouts, assess drug effectiveness, and provide insights for policy guidance. This approach enables us to conduct cost-effective and rapid studies that inform decision-making in a timely manner, especially when dealing with fast-evolving treatment options",

It has contributed to prioritization, ensuring vaccines reach the right people, and measuring their safety and effectiveness. The work done by OpenSAFELY helped create groups for prioritizing vaccine distribution based on COVID mortality risk. The UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) sought data from OpenSAFELY multiple times to inform their decisions.Through our analysis, we identified disparities in vaccination rates among different demographic groups. For instance, we found that certain groups, such as Black or Black British people, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi communities, were more hesitant to take the vaccine. This hesitancy stemmed from concerns about unknown future effects, lack of trust in vaccines, and potential side effects.Additionally, we carefully examined the comparative effectiveness of initial vaccines, how their effectiveness changed over time, and the effectiveness of booster vaccinations. Importance: In terms of policy implications, the role of OpenSAFELY in COVID-19 vaccine delivery was crucial. It demonstrated its ability to address real-time policy questions effectively. Going forward, OpenSAFELY can continue to play an important role in informing policy decisions and addressing emerging questions in the future.",
